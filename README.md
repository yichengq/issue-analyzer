issue-analyzer
=====

issue-analyzer helps to analyze GitHub repo issue counts over time.

The idea is inspired by blog [Analyzing Julia's issue counts over time][http://iaindunning.com/blog/juliaissuecount.html]. It is helpful for developers to understand current status of issues in projects, so issue-analyzer is written to faciliate this process.

issue-analyzer should be able to display more aspects of a project. Suggestions and PRs are always welcome.

### Use access token

Access token could help issue-analyzer fetch data much faster.

2. save the token into file ".oauth2_token"
